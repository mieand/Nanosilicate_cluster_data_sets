# Nanosilicate_cluster_data_sets
Data sets for the paper "Descriptors for binding energies at clusters: The case of nanosilicates as models of interstellar dust grains"

The structures and energies of all DFT-calculated clean clusters and clusters with H and CO adsorbed are provided as Atomic Simulations Environment (ASE) trajectory files.
Furthermore, some example input files are given for the SISSO descriptor identification. These contain also the training data with the property of interest (adsorption energies) and the employed primary features for H and CO. Files are given both for the entire data set (AllData) and for the filtered data set (FilteredData).
