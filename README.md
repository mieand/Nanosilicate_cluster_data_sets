# Nanosilicate_cluster_data_sets
Data sets for the paper "Descriptors for binding energies at clusters: The case of nanosilicates as models of interstellar dust grains"

The structures and energies of all DFT-calculated clean clusters and clusters with H and CO adsorbed are provided as Atomic Simulations Environment (ASE) trajectory files. For each calculation of a cluster-H or cluster-CO structure, there are also four files with the required calculations for carrying out the Boys and Bernardi counterpoise correction for basis set superposition error (single-point calculations of the isolated cluster and adsorbate, each calculated in the monomer and dimer basis sets, respectively).
Furthermore, some example input files are given for the SISSO descriptor identification. These contain also the training data with the property of interest (adsorption energies corrected for basis set superposition error) and the employed primary features for H and CO. Files are given both for the entire data set (AllData) and for the filtered data set (FilteredData).
